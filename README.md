# NewsHub

The idea behind this project is to build a hub where you can find all new articles of different newspapers at one place. This will help you to quickly find the news you're interested in without reviewing all different newspaper websites over and over again.

## Technical details

The website uses the React framework and a SCSS stylesheet.
The website fetches the new articles by accessing the individual RSS-Feeds of the newspaper websites.
